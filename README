# Query Processor

A query processor class that extract words from hard disk files, creates a inverted index with words found and calculates their positions and count ocurrences.

I created an example using a set of HTML files with portuguese text, the example basically has a form for write words sequence. After search the file list with words or terms, you can see a file list matched and access them.
